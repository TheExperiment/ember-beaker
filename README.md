# Ember-beaker

Ember-beaker is the starting point for any ember based project from The Experiment.  

The standard project has been customized to include ember-data, ember-states, and zurbs foundation 5.  

The project is also setup to use SASS.  App.scss is used to include individual scss files included in the styles/base directory. 

.jshintrc has been modified to allow use of $ for Jquery.

Model
A very basic model has been added to the Faq route for demo purposes.
